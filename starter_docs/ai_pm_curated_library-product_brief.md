AI PM Curated Library – Product Brief

Summary

The AI PM Curated Library is a calm, modern, and living knowledge library designed to help Product Managers (PMs) understand and adapt to the evolving craft of product management in the age of AI.

The product offers a trusted collection of free, high-quality resources that explore how AI is reshaping product thinking, decision-making, discovery, and leadership. Rather than optimizing for speed, completion, or rankings, the experience is intentionally designed to encourage browsing, curiosity, and thoughtful exploration.

This is a side project built to give back to the PM community, emphasizing human curation, transparency, and sustainability over growth-at-all-costs.

Target Audience (ICP)

Primary audience:
	•	Practicing Product Managers (ICs and leaders)
	•	PMs who recognize that AI represents a fundamental shift in the role, not just a new tool

Secondary audiences:
	•	PM leaders supporting team evolution
	•	PM-curious practitioners exploring role changes

The product is explicitly not designed for beginners seeking step-by-step tutorials, nor for optimization-driven learners seeking rankings or certifications.

⸻

Problem Statement

Product management is evolving rapidly due to AI, but:
	•	High-quality insights are scattered across blogs, talks, repos, and courses
	•	Much content is outdated, promotional, or paywalled
	•	PMs lack a trusted, low-noise place to explore how the role itself is changing

PMs want a way to browse, learn, and stay intellectually current without feeling overwhelmed, optimized, or sold to.

⸻

Product Goals

Primary Goals
	•	Provide a trusted, curated library of free resources about the evolving PM role
	•	Help PMs spark curiosity and discover new perspectives
	•	Support ongoing learning, not linear progression
	•	Remain calm, accessible, and intellectually honest

Non-Goals (at launch)
	•	Rankings, ratings, or popularity metrics
	•	Paid resources or affiliate-driven content
	•	Gamification or completion tracking
	•	Mandatory accounts or personalization
	•	Algorithmic recommendations

⸻

Core Experience Principles
	•	Curiosity over optimization
	•	Equal-weight resources (no “best” or “top” lists)
	•	Light-touch mentorship, not authority
	•	Human curation, not crowdsourcing
	•	Living library, not static archive

⸻

Information Architecture

Entry Model
	•	Hybrid browsing
	•	Homepage introduces the learning journey
	•	Users can browse broadly or explore suggested entry points

Homepage Purpose

Initiate a learning journey.

The homepage invites exploration and sets tone, rather than funneling users toward outcomes.

⸻

Browsing & Discovery

Browsing Model
	•	Scan-first, card-based layout
	•	Approximately 15 resources visible at once
	•	Pagination (not infinite scroll)

Filters
	•	Intentionally minimal
	•	Focused on orientation, not optimization

Sorting
	•	Default: Recently added
	•	Optional: Alphabetical

Categories
	•	Used as organizational and meaning-making tools
	•	Expected to evolve over time
	•	Users are informed that categories may change as the PM role evolves
	•	Each category includes light editorial framing

⸻

Resource Detail Pages

Each resource has an internal detail page that provides context before linking out.

Purpose
	•	Frame why the resource matters
	•	Build trust
	•	Provide confidence before learning

Typical Content
	•	Resource title
	•	Short summary
	•	Light mentor-style framing (“why this matters”)
	•	Structured metadata (e.g., category, format, time investment)
	•	Quick outbound button near the top
	•	Prominent outbound link at the bottom
	•	Same-category related resources (randomized, equal-weight)

Users typically spend 20–40 seconds on these pages before navigating to the original resource.

⸻

Related Resources
	•	Displayed from the same category
	•	Randomized order
	•	No ranking or prioritization
	•	Supports discovery while preserving equal-weight philosophy

⸻

Content Scope & Rules
	•	Only free resources are included
	•	All resources must be:
	•	Assessed
	•	Approved
	•	Categorized via the backend process
	•	Paid or promotional content is excluded

⸻

Content Lifecycle

Visibility Rules
	•	Only resources that are assessed AND approved are visible
	•	New resources may appear with up to a one-day delay

Updates
	•	Resources are updated in place over time
	•	Summaries, categories, and metadata may evolve
	•	Users always see the latest version

Review Tracking
	•	Each resource tracks a last_reviewed_at timestamp
	•	Used for maintenance and quality control

Archival
	•	Resources may be archived if:
	•	Links break
	•	Content becomes outdated
	•	Quality no longer meets standards
	•	Archived resources are hidden from the UI but retained in the system

⸻

Backend & Frontend Responsibilities

Backend (Source of Truth)
	•	Discovery and daily capture of potential resources
	•	Assessment and evaluation process
	•	Categorization and analysis
	•	Duplicate detection
	•	Approval decisions

Frontend System
	•	Ingests approved backend outputs
	•	Stores resources in a database
	•	Displays content exactly as assessed
	•	Performs no editorial logic

⸻

Submission Model
	•	Users may submit resources via an unauthenticated form
	•	Submissions are private and reviewed by the curator
	•	No public voting or commenting at launch

⸻

Voice & Tone
	•	Single, consistent mentor voice
	•	Calm, thoughtful, lightly playful
	•	Project-led identity (not personality-driven)
	•	Transparency without performative authority

An “About This Project” page provides context and includes curator background, while the primary experience remains project-centric.

⸻

Visual & Brand Direction
	•	Modern product tool aesthetic
	•	Clean, uncluttered UI
	•	Subtle academic/learning undertones
	•	Light humor and warmth through copy, not visuals
	•	Fully responsive design

⸻

Scale & Constraints
	•	Expected scale: ~500 resources
	•	Low-cost hosting and infrastructure
	•	Sustainable as a side project
	•	Manual, tasteful sponsorships or ads may be considered later

⸻

Future Considerations (Not in Scope for v1)

These features may be explored only if there is clear community demand:
	•	User accounts
	•	Saving or voting on resources
	•	Learning paths / tracks
	•	Personalization by format preference
	•	Algorithmic or semi-algorithmic recommendations

The system is designed to allow these extensions without re-architecture, but none are assumed or required.

⸻

Success Definition

Success is not measured by growth metrics alone.

Early indicators of success include:
	•	PMs returning to browse again
	•	Organic sharing within the PM community
	•	Thoughtful submissions from users
	•	The library remaining useful, calm, and trustworthy over time

⸻

Closing

The AI PM Curated Library is intentionally modest in scope but ambitious in care. It exists to support the evolving craft of product management by offering a trusted place to explore, learn, and stay intellectually current — without noise, pressure, or hype.
