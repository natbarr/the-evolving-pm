# AI PM Learning Path - Product Brief

## Executive Summary

The AI PM Learning Path is a curated, open-source collection of learning resources designed to help product managers transition into or advance within AI-focused product roles. The project provides a structured roadmap from foundational concepts through career-level expertise, with quality controls to ensure resources remain accurate and relevant in the fast-moving AI space.

**Mission:** Democratize access to high-quality AI product management education by curating, organizing, and maintaining the best free resources available.

## The Problem

### For Product Managers

The AI product management field is evolving rapidly, creating several challenges:

1. **Information Overload:** Thousands of AI resources exist, but quality varies dramatically. PMs waste time evaluating content that turns out to be superficial, outdated, or irrelevant to product work.

2. **No Clear Learning Path:** Unlike established PM disciplines, there's no consensus on what an AI PM needs to know or in what order to learn it. Self-directed learners struggle to build coherent skill sets.

3. **Rapid Obsolescence:** AI tools, models, and best practices change every few months. A resource that was excellent six months ago may now reference deprecated APIs or outdated pricing.

4. **Technical Barrier:** Many AI resources are either too technical (written for ML engineers) or too superficial (hype pieces). PMs need content pitched at the right level—technically informed but product-focused.

5. **Cost Barriers:** Premium courses and certifications can cost thousands of dollars, putting structured AI education out of reach for many PMs.

### The Result

Product managers interested in AI roles either:
- Spend excessive time searching and vetting resources
- Follow scattered, incomplete learning paths
- Miss critical knowledge areas entirely
- Pay for expensive courses that may not fit their needs

### How It Works

```
Discovery → Evaluation → Classification → Integration → Maintenance
```

1. **Discovery:** New resources identified and added to review queue
2. **Evaluation:** Content assessed for relevance, accuracy, and quality
3. **Classification:** Assigned level, format, content type, and confidence score
4. **Integration:** Placed in appropriate learning phase and category
5. **Maintenance:** Periodic reviews based on content type (3-12 months)

---

## Quality Assurance

### Resource Evaluation Criteria

Every resource is assessed on:

1. **Relevance** - Does it help PMs build AI product skills?
2. **Accuracy** - Is the technical content correct and current?
3. **Accessibility** - Is the content free (or clearly marked as paid)?
4. **Depth** - Does it provide actionable frameworks, not just hype?
5. **Credibility** - Is the author/source reputable in the AI PM space?

### Confidence Scoring

Each resource receives a confidence score (1-5):

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 5 | Authoritative source, extensively verified |
| 4 | Strong source, well-verified (default for new resources) |
| 3 | Good source, some verification gaps |
| 2 | Uncertain accuracy, limited verification |
| 1 | Needs significant verification |

### Staleness Review System

Content types determine review frequency:

| Content Type | Review Frequency | Rationale |
|--------------|------------------|-----------|
| Tool-Specific | 3 months | APIs and tools change frequently |
| Model-Dependent | 4 months | Model capabilities evolve |
| Pricing | 6 months | Economics shift moderately |
| Career | 6 months | Job market conditions change |
| Conceptual | 12 months | Frameworks remain stable longer |

### Lifecycle States

Resources progress through defined states:

```
Active → Flagged → Legacy → Archived
  ↑         ↓
  └── (remediated)
```

- **Active:** Current, accurate, recommended
- **Flagged:** Potential issues identified, under review
- **Legacy:** Outdated in some aspects, use with caution
- **Archived:** No longer recommended
