      "summary": "A ~7-minute video tracing the evolution of coding agent concepts from simple rules files to the modern skills ecosystem. Explains how static context (rules) and dynamic context (skills) form the two fundamental building blocks, covering the progression through rules, commands, MCP servers, sub-agents, modes, hooks, and skills. Provides conceptual clarity for navigating the increasingly complex coding agent landscape, with practical examples from Cursor including lazy-loading MCP tools and progressive disclosure patterns."
